# How this works

Greetings,
In this site the events are displayed automatically you just have to give the details of the event.

So, How this is going to work is being described in following steps:

- Navigate to the Events.json file present in the src folder
- Add / remove / modify any of the object that look something line this
- ```
  {
    "event": "Dummy event",
    "date": "8 Feb 2023",
    "description": "This is just for explanation purpose how these events got added here because in the Event.json file there is a object for each event and if you add other objects in that json file present in the src folder and then commit those changes you can see that those automatically get reflected on the site.",
    "registrationLink": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeu8dev2_qNJ_MCoDL310I4Y538gK8gkFC_28dHZ4xtl1yM3g/viewform?usp=send_form"
  }
  ```
- After editing the object commit the changes.
- wait for 2-3min and there you go the changes will be reflected on the site.

## How I made this project
Hi, I am Tejasav Khandelwal. I used react to create this project. As react was new to me I watched tutorials and tried to create this application. The knowledge of javascript helped me a lot. I tried my best to make this project. I hope you like it
